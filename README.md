COLBERT is a VR application for exploring complex 3D models including associated metadata. The models can be (dis-)assembled based on their hierarchical structure. The application is usable with or without a VR headset, or alternatively both options can be used collaboratively. Additionally, there is a multiplayer mode through which additional users can participate via local network/internet.
